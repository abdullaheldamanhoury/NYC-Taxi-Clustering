A Taxi driver can be informed only of a neighborhood with an elevated tip, without a more precise location.
That's why the solution developed was based on the administrative division of previouslyManhattan. 
An area could be any zone of arbitrary size. Instead of partitioning Manhattan into neighborhoods, 
we will search for small zones with elevated tip. A Machine Learning k-means , Bisecting k-means and Gaussian Mixture algorithms
will be leveraged to obtain areas of interest.
Each such an area is a cluster of Taxi rides with elevated tips. A cluster of Taxi rides will be later on called cluster.
